   	 <h2>The Secret of the Bounty Skulls</h2>
   	 <p>Bounty Skulls are most commonly found via Bounty Maps, which lead players to a specific Island that are home to 1-4 Crews of Skeleton Captains. Bounty Maps can be received as singular Quests or as a part of Order of Souls Voyages. When on a marked Island, Players have to locate the Skeleton Crews, which can be of any of the five types: Bone, Gold, Plant, Shadow or Ashen. Most Skeleton Captains are preceded by a couple of regular Skeleton waves before they make their appearance. Skeleton Captains have more health than their regular crewmates. The health of the skeletons is dependent on the difficulty of the Voyage. Once a Captain is defeated, it will leave behind a random Bounty Skull, the type of which is notified to the whole Crew. Captain Ghost Ships usually drop Ghostly Bounty Skulls. Singular Bounty Skulls can also be found on Islands or as rewards for completing any Encounters on the Seas.</p>
